# Heart-Disease-Prediction
# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction Web App** built with **Flask** (Backend) and **Bootstrap** (Frontend).  
It uses different machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, ANN) to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on input parameters.

---

## 🚀 Features
- User-friendly interface with Bootstrap  
- Input patient health details (age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)  
- Multiple ML models for prediction  
- Flask-based backend for model inference  
- Deployed on cloud (Heroku/Streamlit)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Flask, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, Numpy)  
- **Bootstrap** (Frontend UI)  
- **SQLite / CSV** (Dataset handling)  
- **Gunicorn** (for deployment)
